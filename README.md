This code is for household characteristic prediction. The main code is in the  `lib`. If you want to directly run this code, try run this following command:
`cd exps`
`python feaderated_main.py`

## how to change

there are seveal parts in this code.
`exps/feaderated_main.py` is the main code. It defines model aggregation, the selection of different heterogeneous type. It is easy to understand.
`lib/models/*` define different model.
`lib/options.py` defines different parameter. `feaderated_main.py` will read this file and load those settings. Acually, for easy settings, I defines a series of settings between 132-143 lines in `feaderated_main.py`, just like label files and heterogeneous type. You can find them in this code.
`lib/utils.py`defines different dataloader.
`lib/update.py` defines model training part.
